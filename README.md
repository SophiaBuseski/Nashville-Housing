# Nashville-Housing
Nashville Housing SQL Cleaning Project.

## Project Overview 
In this project, I undertook a thorough cleaning and standardization of a Nashville housing dataset. The primary goal was to ensure data consistency and accuracy, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis or queries related to housing information, taxes, ownership, addresses, and sales in Nashville. The data was initially provided in an Excel file and further processed using SQL.

## Objective 
The main aim was to clean the data to ensure it was accurate, consistent, and standardized, thereby making it reliable for future analysis and decision-making.

## Data 
- Excel Dataset [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/Nashville-Housing/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing.xlsx)
  
- Data Cleaning Code [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/Nashville-Housing/blob/main/NashvilleHousing%20Clean%20Up.sql)


## Methodology 
  ### 1. Data Cleaning: 
  
  #### Standardization: 
  - Ensured all data entries followed a consistent format. This included standardizing addresses,
    correcting punctuation, and ensuring uniform responses.

  #### Address Formatting:
  - Corrected and standardized all addresses to a uniform format, ensuring accuracy and
  consistency.

  #### Duplicate Removal: 
  - Identified and deleted duplicate records to prevent redundancy and ensure data integrity.

  #### New Columns Creation: 
  - Created new columns where necessary to improve data organization and facilitate better
  analysis.
  
  #### Unnecessary Data Removal: 
  - Removed unused or redundant columns to streamline the dataset.

### 2. Tools & Technologies 
#### Excel: 
- Used for preliminary data cleaning tasks such as initial duplicate detection and basic formatting.
  
#### SQL: 
- Employed for more advanced data cleaning operations, ensuring data standardization and consistency across the dataset.

## Key Findings 
#### 1. Standardized Data: 
Achieved a fully standardized dataset with consistent formatting and accurate entries.

#### 2. Enhanced Data Quality: 
Improved the overall quality of the data by removing duplicates and correcting inconsistencies.

#### 3. Organized Structure: 
Developed a well-organized dataset with relevant columns, facilitating easier access and analysis.
  
## Impact 
The cleaned and standardized dataset provides a reliable foundation for any analysis related to Nashville housing. This is particularly beneficial for:


  - Housing Market Analysis: Enabling accurate and comprehensive analysis of housing trends, prices, and sales.
  
  - Tax Assessments: Assisting in accurate property tax calculations and assessments.
  
  - Property Ownership Research: Providing reliable data for inquiries into property ownership and related legal
  matters.

  - Urban Planning and Development: Supporting urban planners and developers with precise and consistent data for
  informed decision-making.


By leveraging Excel for initial cleaning and SQL for advanced data processing, this project highlights the importance of meticulous data cleaning and standardization in preparing datasets for effective analysis and decision-making. The resultant dataset is now a valuable resource for various stakeholders involved in Nashvilleâ€™s housing market and urban development.
